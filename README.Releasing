How to release a new version of the NodeSoftware

About versioning:
* Version numbers like "11.5" reflect the standard.
* NodeSoftware adds suffixes r1, r2 etc for incremental
  updates based on that standard.

  from the tag at GitHub and put it on the web. And to
  update their build of the docs.
