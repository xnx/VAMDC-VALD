2010-04-21 running on melkor, djangos test-server (single thread),
once with sqlite backend, once with mysql same import in both
databases, same indexes

query all Fe transitions, 3000 < Ã… < 3500, plus corresponging 
states, species, references:

sqlite -> xsams:  45 sec,   4.5  MB ( 0.21 gzipped)
sqlite -> csv:    45  sec,  0.7 MB ( 0.14 gzipped)
mysql -> xsams:  90,51  sec,  size see above
mysql -> csv:  57,37 sec,  size see above

caching. these numbers also mean that the query is the bottle neck,
not the creation of XML. However creating xsams might need more
advanced queries to the db - thereby increasing overhead...

If I leave out the element constraint:
