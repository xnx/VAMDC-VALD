The main concepts behind the implementation
=============================================

The following is a glossary-like list that shortly touches upon various 
subjects that one should be aware of before setting up a new VAMDC node.

The database
----------------

As already mentioned in the :ref:`intro`, data needs to reside in a 
relational database in order to use the node software for a VAMDC node. 
This is what we mean by *database* in the following, in contrast to 
*data set* which means the data in any format or *data model*:

The data model(s)
------------------------

The *data model* is a definition of the database layout in form of 
Python code where a *class* is defined for each table in the database 
and the members of the class are *fields* that correspond to the tables' 
columns. The data model also defines the connections between tables. For 
an existing database the data model can be automatically generated, 
otherwise it needs to be written for a new node (see
:ref:`newnode` later) and will then be used to create the database.

Having this code representation of the database layout has 
many advantages, among these are:

* automatic (re-)creation of the database, independent of the engine
* no need to learn SQL
* easy queries
* additional features like easily traversing linked tables in both directions.

.. note::
    Sometimes the singular *data model* refers to a single model 
    (i.e. a table in the database) and sometimes the full set of models, 
    describing the whole database layout.

The VAMDC dictionary
---------------------

In order to facilitate automated communication, there is a need for a 
set of names that identify a certain type of data. Each name is unique 
and is uniquely associated with a description, a data type, a unit where 
applicable and a (non-mandatory) restriction.

For illustration, let's have a look at one entry of the dictionary:

================= ============= ======================================================================================================== ============== ============= ======
 Keyword            short descr  long description                                                                                         data type      restriction  unit
================= ============= ======================================================================================================== ============== ============= ======
AtomMassNumber     Atomic mass   Atomic mass in Daltons, which is the same as the unified mass units (1Da = 1u = 1.660 538 86 (28) e-27) (Float|Double)  >1            amu
================= ============= ======================================================================================================== ============== ============= ======

It is the first column that contains the *name* that we use globally 
within VAMDC for a certain bit of information. This is what we mean in 
the following when we talk about "global names" or "keywords".

The full VAMDC dictionary is still being worked on and it currently 
resides at http://dictionary.vamdc.eu/ where also some helper tools
are provided.

At the nodes, the dictionary is used in the following different ways. 
Note that some keywords do not make sense being used in all three 
cases. Common sense applies.

.. note::
    The Returnables and Restrictables, as described in the 
    following, are different for each node (depending on the data it offers 
    and its structure) and need to be written when setting up a new node.


Returnables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each node keeps a list of global names that we call the *Returnables*. 
This list contains the names associated with the kinds of information 
that a node has to offer. This is list is offered as XML at the 
*tap/capabilities/* URL end point which allows user applications to 
decide whether it is worth to query a certain node for a certain bit of 
data, or not.

The node software stores the Returnables not only as a list of global 
names, but as a list of key-value pairs where the names are the keys and 
the values are the corresponding places of the data in the *data model* 
(see above). This way, the Returnables become a simple one-to-one map 
between the global names, used by all VAMDC nodes, and the node-specific 
layout of the database.

This "translation" is then used, among other things, by the code that 
fills the data into a certain output format which in turn can become 
node-independant. Thereby each Returnable corresponds to a certain 
place (a column in table format, or a certain XML tag) in the output 
format.


Restrictables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is the list of global names that make sense to use as constraints for a 
certain node and therefore tells which names from the dictionary can be 
used in the WHERE-clause of a query to the node (see query language below).

Again, the node software uses the Restrictables as a list of key-value 
pairs where the keys are the global names and the values are the 
corresponding place in the data model. As for the Returnables, this 
one-to-one map of global names to custom data model allows to translate 
between the two - this time when the query is parsed at arrival. The 
code for parsing the query uses this and can thus be re-used by all 
nodes without altering the code.


Requestables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requestables are a third way of using the dictionary. They are used in 
the SELECT-clause of the SQL expression when one wants to recieve only a 
subset of the data that matches the restrictions. For example, *SELECT 
Species, RadiativeTransitions* would return only the fields in this
group and skip any information about the states, if it were available.


The registry
---------------

The registry is a central web service where all VAMDC nodes are 
registered with their access URL and some additional information. This 
allows finding nodes before sending queries to them. You will need to 
register your node there once the setup is complete.



.. note::
    What follows below is not necessary to know for setting up a new 
    VAMDC node but it helps to get the broader picture.


TAP services
---------------

TAP stands for *Table Access Protocol* and is a Virtual Observatory 
standard definition of a web service. The detailed specs can be found 
`here <http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/TAP/>`_. All VAMDC nodes offer 
their data though a TAP-like interface which means that the URL 
end-points are named like in TAP, the most important being */tap/sync* 
for a data query which returns the data synchronously (in the immediate 
reply). Also the attribute names for submitting a query are strongly 
inspired by TAP so that a query to a single VAMDC node looks something 
like this::

    http://domain.of.your.node/tap/sync/?LANG=VSS1&FORMAT=XSAMS&QUERY=query string

VAMDC nodes currently only use and support a subset of the TAP standard, 
i.e. that parts that are needed within the VAMDC. Keep in mind that 
users will not primarily query an individual node but use a higher level 
tool like the VAMDC portal for querying many nodes at once. Data 
providers that want to set up their own VAMDC node do not really need to 
care about TAP either.

The more detailed specification of the VAMDC variant of a TAP service 
can be found in the standards documentation at http://vamdc.org/documents/standards/.


The query language
---------------------

The node software uses the *VAMDC SQL-subset 2* (VSS2) which is a superset of VSS1 for query language as defined in the VAMDC standards. This is 
basically a SQL-like string where the database layout of the 
node does not need to be known - instead one uses the keywords 
from the dictionary in the WHERE part to restrict the selection of data. 
This means that all nodes understand identical queries and there is no 
need to adapt the query to a certain node.

Details can be found in the VAMDC-TAP specification (see link above) and 
should not be necessary to know for setting up a new VAMDC node. 
Defining the Restrictables and Returnables is enough for allowing the 
node software to take care of the rest.

.. _xsamsconcepts:

The XSAMS schema
-------------------

XSAMS stands for XML Schema for Atoms, Molecules and Solids. It defines 
a strict way to represent data in XML. XSAMS is the format in which 
VAMDC nodes send their data replies.

Link to the `VAMDC-XSAMS project on Sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsams/>`_.

The NodeSoftware provides an implementation of the XSAMS schema and data providers need not know it in detail to set up a VAMDC node. However, basic knowledge of its structure is needed to be able to write the few bits of code as explained in the next chapter.

XSAMS is a hierarchical structure which simplified looks like this:

.. image:: xsamsbasic.png
   :width: 500 px
   :alt: Basic structure of XSAMS

Inside each box resides all the data that corresponds to it. The *atom* box holds the name, atomic number, masses, iosotopes, ionization and so on. The *atomic state* box holds the state energy, quantum numbers and so on.

The different parts are interlinked, for example each atomic state has an ID
and the transitions can refer to them as their initial and final state. Sources
(i.e. publications) can be referenced, again by their ID, for each bit of
information provided.

The generic XSAMS generator
------------------------------

The node software comes with an implementation of the XSAMS that can (but need
not necessesarily) be used by all nodes, aka the XSAMS *generator*. This frees
data providers from the need to know about XML and the details of the schema.
In order for this to work, data providers need fill the *Returnables* as
described above and in the next chaper. The generator then knows how to put the
data into the schema.

In principle, XSAMS allows many more nested loops than are shown in the diagram
above. But since each node needs to build from its database the structure that
matches the hierarchy, we have made some deliberate simplifications. For
example we treat each ion and isotope or an atom as a different atom/species.
This means that skip the complexity of having five or more nested loops at the
expense of replicating some information.

The portal
---------------

The portal is the obvious example of a *user application* that makes use of
VAMDC nodes. It is a web site that facilitates the submission of a query to
many nodes at once by providing a web form out of which it assembles the query
string which it then sends to one or many nodes, gathers the results from each
of them and presents them to the user.
